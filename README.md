Please follow this link [Dani's TIC-TAC-TOE](https://daniiblack.github.io/project0/).

### Open the webpage, grab your bestest imaginary friend, your mother; father; cousin.. anyone you feel needs *a good thrashing* and get started! 
**Don't overthink it:** 
- Two player game, you must play from the same webpage on the same device. 
- Consider playing a quick round of **paperScissorsRock**, whoever wins gets to start
- Remember to ensure the looser has to do some unfavourable chores. Keep the stakes high for maximum enjoyment. 

### The approach? Read on: 
#### The secret to being a kick-ass babyCoder, is accepting the fact that sometimes your code is just a collage of hacks and tips picked up whilst stumbling along the good way. 
___The Challenges:___
1. Getting the styling to resize so that the game could be played on a phone (without using Bootstrap)
2. Refining the logic in the javascript in order to try and keep the code short and succinct 
3. I put CSS off to last, and ran out of time to make the game as pretty as it deserves to be 
4. The main bug I came across was that the Player rendered (player1 or 2) broke and I had to mess about with the order of the functions to fix.

___The Highlights___
1. I loved piecing the HTML and JS together
2. Using an array filled with empty strings in order to store data as the game is played was a satisfying solution 
3. Using an array of arrays of winning move combinations was also fun 

___Remaining pieces___
1. The reset button does not yet work
2. I would like to allow players to select their own avatar 
3. The page could be much more pleasing to look at 
4. The screen does not yet render who won
